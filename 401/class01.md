## How to Solve Programming Problems
### When most programmers are given a programming problem in an interview, they make several key mistakes.  The most severe of those is the improper allocation of time.

I am going to give you a simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem.

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.


#### Programming is automation plain and simple.  You may have the ability to skip the manual steps and jump directly to code, but there is a manual process which is the foundation of any code you write.

#### People often don’t realize how valuable this step is.  It is much easier to rearrange and reconstruct and idea or algorithm in your head than it is in code.

#### Many times you can skip this step if you have a really good handle on the problem or your previous steps already created a detailed enough description of the solution that coding it is already a 1 to 1 translation.

#### If you struggle here, there are usually two possible reasons:

1. You didn’t break down the problem into small enough steps
2. You don’t know your programming language well enough to do the conversion

Optimize the real code
Sometimes this step isn’t necessary, but it’s worth taking a look at your code and figuring out if you can cut out a few lines or do something simpler.

This method of tackling a problem is called “divide and conquer” and is quite effective.  
A good way to know where to break a problem in half is to think about what part of the problem if already given to you would make solving the rest easy.

### “Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness

### Most people prize “being busy.” They proclaim it with pride, as if it’s a badge of honor.
### But for most people, this “busyness” is nothing more than distraction and procrastination from what really matters. They just like feeling busy.

#### Deep work means absolutely not tolerating distractions and producing monumental quality and quantity in a very short time. This is how you can complete far more with focused efforts than unfocused efforts with far more time.

#### If you let people know your time is free and low-valued, people will treat it as such.
#### In reality, a lot of people are living a frenzied, busy life. They wear their business as a badge of honor, and brag about their full schedules.

## what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

1. Understand
2. Plan
3. Divide
4. Stuck



##  5 Whys technique (sometimes known as 5Y). This is a simple but powerful tool for cutting quickly through the outward symptoms of a problem to reveal its underlying causes, so that you can deal with it once and for all.

### How to Use the 5 Whys
1. Assemble a Team
2. Define the Problem
3. Ask the First "Why?"
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
5. Know When to Stop
6. Address the Root Cause(s)
7. Monitor Your Measures
