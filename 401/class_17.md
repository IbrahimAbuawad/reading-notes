## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Describe “The Cloud”
#### "The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers

### What is a container
#### A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies

### What is auto-scaling
#### AWS Auto Scaling lets you build scaling plans that automate how groups of different resources respond to changes in demand.

### What is bandwidth?
#### The maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time.

### How do cloud providers compute service costs?
####  calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor.



## Terminology

- Server Instances:
  - A server instance is a collection of SQL Server Databases which are run by a solitary SQL server or instance

- Containers:
  - A standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another

- Cloud Services:
  - Wide range of servicces delievered on demand to companies and customers over the internet
  - designed to provide easy, and affordable access to applications and resources without the need for internal infrastruture or hardware

- Cloud Architecture:
  - How individual technologies are integrated to create clouds/cloud services
  - IT environments that abstract pool and share scalable resources across a network

- AWS:
  - Amazon Web Services
  - A platform that offers flexible, reliable, scalable, easy-to-uses and cost-effective cloud computing solutions

- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku:
  - Elactic Compute Cloud
    - Web service that provides secure, resizeable computer capacity iin the cloud
    - designed to make web-scale cloud computing easy for developers
  - Beanstalk
    - easy to use-service for deploying and scaling web applications and services
    - Simply upload code to beanstalk
      - Beanstalk automatically handles depolyment
  - Heroku
    - Lots of setup to update server/app


## Preparation Materials

### AWS S3
#### Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier.
#### Advantages of using Amazon S3 :

1. Creating buckets 
2. Storing data 
3. Downloading data
4. Permissions
5. Standard interfaces

##### A key is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket. Every object in a bucket has exactly one key. 
The combination of a bucket, key, and version ID uniquely identify each object.

### AWS Lambda Basics
#### Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
#### Lambda is an ideal compute service for many application scenarios, as long as you can run your application code using the Lambda standard runtime environment
#### Lambda features :

1. Concurrency and scaling controls
2. Functions defined as container images
3. Code signing
4. Lambda extensions
5. Function blueprints
6. Database access

### CDN
#### A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.
#### Is a CDN the same as a web host?
#### While a CDN does not host content and can’t replace the need for proper web hosting, it does help cache content at the network edge, which improves website performance
#### What are the benefits of using a CDN?

1. Improving website load time
2. Reducing bandwidth costs 
3. Increasing content availability and redundancy
4. Improving website security
