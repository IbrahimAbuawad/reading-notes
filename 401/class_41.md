## Review, Research, and Discussion 
#### Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”
#####  Redux Toolkit's goal is to help simplify common Redux use cases. It is not intended to be a complete solution for everything you might want to do with Redux, but it should make a lot of Redux-related code you need to write a lot simpler
#### What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
##### Helps to solve three major problems with Redux: configuring a Redux store, adding numerous packages to get Redux to things, and removing unnecessary or boilerplate code.
 
### Term
#### redux toolkit slices: A function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state.
#### namespace: a namespace is a set of signs (names) that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds.

## Preparation Materials

#### React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks.
#### Most components can be customized when they are created, with different parameters. These creation parameters are called props.

#### If you created an Expo project and you want a way to add custom native modules, this guide will explain how to use ExpoKit for that purpose.
