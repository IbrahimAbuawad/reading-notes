# Reading: Application State with Redux
## Review, Research, and Discussion

### What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage” ?
#### One of the biggest advantages of using tokens over cookies is the fact that token authentication is stateless .
### expalin third party cookies

## preperation material :
#### Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces. Similar to (and inspired by) Facebook’s Flux architecture, it was created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark.
#### The principles of Redux aren’t new, but they are packaged and presented for you in an easy to use a library that not only elevates your applications but also improves your general understanding of building JavaScript UIs.
