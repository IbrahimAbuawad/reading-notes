## Css
#### CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
#### Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
#### Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
#### Declarations are made up of two parts :
##### 1. the properties of the element.
##### 2.  the values of those properties.
#### you can use css as:

##### 1. external :
`body { font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;}`

##### 2. internal : 
*<style type="text/css"> body { font-family: arial; background-color: rgb(185,179,175);} h1 { color: rgb(255 255,255);} </style>*

##### 3. inline :
`<p style="color:red"></p>` .

### **Color** 
#### Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions .
#### There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
##### 1. RGB values .
##### 2. hex codes .
##### 3. color names .

#### Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
#### CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
#### CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
