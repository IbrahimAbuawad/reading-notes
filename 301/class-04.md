## Thinking in React

#### React is premier way to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript.

#### One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them.

#### mock looks like this :

##### For this example, we left it as part of ProductTable because it is part of rendering the data collection which is ProductTable’s responsibility

####  building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking,

#### You can build top-down or bottom-up. That is, you can either start with building the components higher up in the hierarchy

#### There are two types of “model” data in React:

1. Props
2. States

#### React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy. 

####  It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state.
