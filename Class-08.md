## HTML
### Layout
#### "div" elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page . 
##### Example :
`<div><h1>Content</h1><p>Content</p></div>`
#### Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
#### The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
####  Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
##### Example on grid view :

![Grid](https://images.template.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/20082451/WooCommerce-Grid-WordPress-Website-Theme-59.jpg)


#### Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling) .
#### You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
