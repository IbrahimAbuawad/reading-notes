## HTML
### Structure
#### HTML pages are text documents.
#### HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled  brackets) to give the information they surround special  meaning.
#### Tags are often referred to as elements.
#### Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes  the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
#### Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more  about the content of that element.
#### Attributes require a name and a value.

### Extra Markup
#### DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
#### You can add comments to your code between the markers.
##### Example :
`<!--add your comment here-->`
#### The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
##### Example :
`<h1 class="className" id="idName"></h1>`
#### Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.
#### The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.

### HTML5 layout
#### The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
#### the HTML5 support using 
##### Examples of usage include:
1. Images
2. Videos
3. Graphs
4. Diagrams
5. Code samples
6. Text that supports the main

#### Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
#### To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, 
##### Example of HTML5 :

`<body> `
`<div class="wrapper"><header> `
` <h1>Yoko's Kitchen</h1> `
 `<nav>` 
  `<ul> `
   ` <li><a href="" class="current">home</a></li>` 
   ` <li><a href="">classes</a></li> `
    `<li><a href="">catering</a></li>` 
    `<li><a href="">about</a></li> `
    `<li><a href="">contact</a></li>` 
  `</ul> `
 `</nav> `
`</header>` 
`</body> `

### PROCESS & Design
#### Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
#### You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
#### Wireframes : allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
#### Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.

## JavaScript
### ABC Beginning
#### It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript  file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and  CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension. 

#### The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages  to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like  the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file). 
#### If you view the source code of the page in the browser,  the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,  because the script works with the model of the web  page that the browser has created.
