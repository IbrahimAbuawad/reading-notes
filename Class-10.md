### Debugging
#### **If you understand execution contexts (which have two stages) and stacks, you are more likely to find the error in your code.** 
#### **Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction.**
#### The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try to find the exact error.
#### **If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements.**
