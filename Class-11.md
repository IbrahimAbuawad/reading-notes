## HTML
### Images
#### The **img** element is used to add images to a web page .
#### You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.
##### Example :
`<img src="url of image"/>`
#### You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.

#### You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image
#### X Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.
#### When cropping images it is important not to lose valuable information. It is best to source images that are the correct shape if possible.
#### we can change width and height of image . 

#### To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites

##### Example :
###### img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of quokka" width="600" height="450"

### Video and audio 

#### You can review what all the HTML features do in the article linked above; for our purposes here, the most interesting attribute is controls, which enables the default set of playback controls.

#### One big issue with the native browser controls is that :
##### 1. they are different in each browser 
##### 2. the native controls in most browsers aren't very keyboard-accessible.
