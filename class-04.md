## HTML
### Links
#### Links are created using the "a" tag element.
#### The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
##### Example :
`<a href='https://www.google.com'>Google</a>`
#### If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs
#### You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field
##### Example :
``<a href='ibrahim@gmail.com'>MyEmail</a>``
#### You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.


### Layout
#### "div" elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page . 
##### Example :
`<div><h1>Content</h1><p>Content</p></div>`
#### Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
#### The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
####  Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
##### Example on grid view :

#### Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling) .
#### You can include multiple CSS files in one page.


## JavaScript
### Functions, Methods, and Objects
#### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a  specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can  reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 
##### Example : 
##### *function updateMessage() {var el = document.getElementByld('message'}; el .textContent = msg;*

##### xample of calling a function :
`sayHello();`
##### if it has an information :
`sayHello('Width','height');`


## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
#### Iterative loops. Code reviews. Fast feedback. Error checking and linting. These are software engineering practices that have proven to dramatically improve the quality of code developers produce.
#### pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together
#### pair programming commonly involves two roles:
##### 1. the Driver
##### 2. the Navigator

#### there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language:
##### 1. Listening
##### 2. Speaking
##### 3. Reading
##### 4. writing

#### two programmers may come to a solution faster than one programmer on their own.
#### Pair programming not only improves programming skills, but can also help programmers develop their interpersonal skills.
#### benefit of pair programming : 
##### 1. Greater efficiency :
##### 2. Engaged collaboration
##### 3. Learning from fellow students
##### 4. Social skills
##### 5. Job interview readiness
##### 6. Work environment readiness
