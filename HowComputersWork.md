## what makes a Computer , a Computer
#### 4 parts of computer to do tasks :
##### 1. Input
##### 2. Output
##### 3. Memory
##### 4. CPU
#### Input is the stuff that the world does .
##### Examples : microphone , camera , keyboard .
#### all the inputs give computer information and stored in MEMORY .
#### then PROCESS tasks information from memory .
#### and then it gives OUTPUT .
#### Software in computer Control HardWare .
#### by the 20th century computers started using electrical component and it was really slow .

## Binary & Data
#### computers work on ones and zeros(Binary numbers)
#### the positions in binary go like : 1,2,4,8,16 ...etc 
#### information is represented inside the computer using tiny electrical signals going on and off .
#### if you use more wires you get more bits .
#### with 8 wires , you can store numbers between 0 and 255 .
#### all the information represented with binary numbers : text , images , sound and so on .
 
## Circuits and logic 
#### a computer uses millions of teeny electronic component , which come togother to form circuits .
#### if a  signal give it a 1 the circuit give you 0 , and the oppeset give you a 0
#### a cicuit will take two electrical signals , each one might be a 1 or 0
#### Logical Gates is : And , NAND , NOT , NOR , OR , XOR .

## Hardware & Software 
#### inside a computing device it have bunch of circits , chips , wires this called hardware .
#### Software is all the computer program or code running on a machine .
#### the CPU is a master chip that controls all the other parts of computer .
#### CPU fetches and executes operations in sequence . 
#### CPU can know which circuits to use and when to use them .
