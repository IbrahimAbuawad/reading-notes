### **what is a growth mindset**

##### A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

#### 1. **jealous make me love challenge**

##### for me I was fiercely jealous of people I thought were more successful or more intelligent. But, with the help of our culture of openness and honesty, I was able to understand    how the work I do relates to the work of my peers, and how it all comes together to create something awesome.

#### 2. **effort** 
##### on the mornings when I get up and ride? I feel better. It’s hard work, sure, and the good feeling isn’t instantaneous (though sometimes it is). But when the ride is over and my body feels better, my spirit is stronger why because i think about Effort i will take. I’m proud of myself, and that goes a long, long way.

#### 3. **Challenges**
##### When I’m faced with a challenging coding problem, I have a tendency to work over one particular aspect of it again and again until I conclude that it’s impossible or that I’m incapable of solving it.
